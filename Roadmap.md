Set up Steps 
- Create Github repo and Make public for review and source control 
    - Create this doc
    - Create Works Cited
    - Create Dirs for data 
- Get Weather API Account Set up
    - Collect Sample Data to test with
- Create Works Cited 

Create simple Diagrams for Design elements 
- Data Structure for the Earthquake data 
- Sliding average algorithm (if needed)


IMPLEMENTATION

MVP: Get all earthquakes from 1 hour of program start time
Stretch: Constant updates 

S = Small, 10 mins
M = Med, 30 mins 
L = Large, 45-60mins or significant ramp up necessary

Development Milestones 
- Evaluate and Transfer Provided Code (S) 
    [D] for Weather API 
    - for Earthquake 
    - for algo unit test 
- Write Sliding Average Algorithm 
- Incorporate Sliding Algo Unit Tests 
- Set up API Infrastructure (M)
    - For Weather (S)
    - For Earthquake 
- Implement Data Structure for earthquake 
- 
- Take user input (not hard coded)
    - Verify User Input 
- Get Continuous Updates (M)
- Refine Installation process for people who grab it 

Quality Refinements 
- Ensure Const Correctness for inputs to functions
