Set up Steps 
- Create Github repo and Make public for review and source control 
    - Create this doc
    - Create Works Cited
    - Create Dirs for data 
- Get Weather API Account Set up
    - Collect Sample Data to test with
- Create Works Cited 

Create simple Diagrams for Design elements 
- Data Structure for the Earthquake data 
- Sliding average algorithm (if needed)


IMPLEMENTATION

MVP: Get all earthquakes from 1 hour of program start time
Stretch: Constant updates 

S = Small, 10 mins
M = Med, 30 mins 
L = Large, 45-60mins or significant ramp up necessary
[D] = Done, otherwise not done

Development Milestones 
- Evaluate and Transfer Provided Code (S) 
    [D] for Weather API 
    - for Earthquake 
    [D] for algo unit test 
[D] Write Sliding Average Algorithm 
[D] Incorporate Sliding Algo Unit Tests
[D] Take basic user input for n and API Key (not hard coded) 
- Set up API Infrastructure (M)
    [D] For Weather (S)
    - For Earthquake 
- Implement Data Structure for earthquake 
    - Store Name, Temp, timestamp, 
- 

    - Verify User Input 
- Get Continuous Updates (M)
- Refine Installation process for people who grab it 

Quality Refinements 
- Ensure Const Correctness for inputs to functions
